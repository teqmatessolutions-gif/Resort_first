# Chat Context for Resuming Work

## Current Issue Being Worked On

**Issue:** Not all checked-in/booked rooms are appearing in the "Process New Checkout" dropdown on the Billing page.

**Status:** Investigation in progress - need to check booking status values in database.

## Previous Session Summary

1. ‚úÖ Fixed guest capacity validation to check adults and children separately (not total capacity)
2. ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate booking entries issue by using composite keys (`regular_${id}` and `package_${id}`)
3. üîç Currently investigating: Missing rooms in billing page dropdown

## Files Modified in This Session

- `dasboard/src/pages/Bookings.jsx` - Added separate adults/children capacity validation
- `ResortApp/app/api/checkout.py` - Started investigation for billing dropdown issue

## Next Steps Needed

1. Check actual booking status values in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT status, COUNT(*) FROM bookings GROUP BY status;
   SELECT DISTINCT status, COUNT(*) FROM package_bookings GROUP BY status;
   ```

2. If status values have `checked_in` (with underscore), update filter in `ResortApp/app/api/checkout.py` line 37, 42, 74, and 81 to include it:
   ```python
   # Current: .filter(Booking.status.in_(['checked-in', 'booked']))
   # Update to: .filter(Booking.status.in_(['checked-in', 'checked_in', 'booked']))
   ```

3. Deploy and test the fix.

## Recent Commit
- Capacity validation fix deployed to production
- Project summary document created and committed

## Important Notes
- Status values may vary: `checked-in` (hyphen) vs `checked_in` (underscore)
- Frontend normalizes both: `.replace(/[-_]/g, '')`
- Backend uses hyphen format in most places
